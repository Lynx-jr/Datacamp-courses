# Datacamp-courses
Subscribed for a full year to learn about Python, R, and SQL. Hopefully this helps anyone who have a hard time coding for the first time

So I'm gonna collect my answers here and perhaps add some explanation (depends on what language was in my mind at that time, warning* you might see Chinese + English + Japanese)

Thanks for clicking in and have fun!
